**_Abstract_**

The primary mission of the Network for Agent-based modelling of Socio-ecological Systems in Archaeology (NASSA) is to create and maintain an open library of agent-based modelling (ABM) components. The initiative distinguishes itself in goal and scope from other open science libraries, such as the CoMSES Network Model Library. First, the library is designed to be a collection of modules, not models, formatted and documented independently following a common but flexible standard. Its overall aim is to facilitate its future re-use within the broader community of researchers. Second, the library is first-and-foremost archaeological, meaning that it is both pragmatically specialised, allowing more immediate use in our field, and intrinsically interdisciplinary, thus including modules on many subjects and domains.

This paper will briefly present an overview of NASSA and the library developed so far. Given the still early stage of the library, the paper focuses on giving enough instructions and examples to encourage future submissions. We will review the main aspects of NASSA organisation and infrastructure and offer a scheme of the library concept, including our definition of modules as either algorithms or sub-models. We will describe the submission process and, most importantly, explain the metadata and minimum file structure required for submissions. Next, we will offer three practical examples of the process of creating modules out of pre-existing models and/or code and preparing the related metadata for submission.
